# What is MLD?
MLD code can calculate Molecular Dyanamics and Lattice Dynamics simulation with QUANTUM ESPRESSO results. 
I have created this code to calculate characteristcs of harmonic force propeties. The features of this is listed below:
- Educational.
- It can combine force field with Ab initio calculation(QE). However only harmonic force is available.
- It can calculate Spectrum energy deinsity.
- source code is wrriten with Fortran. The software is fast.

Also If you want to simulate MD simulateion, you can try lammps(https://www.lammps.org)

# Future Plan
- enable to use other force field (EAM,FS,)
- more user Friendly.LAMMPS code is highly developed , but complicated. The code will be develop and easy to understand the concept.
- rewrite Rust code to make faster and safty
- combine PINN potential
